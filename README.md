# sorting-visualizer
 A sorting visualizer written in opal

the visualizer uses a text user interface made with picotui, so it won't work on Windows. instead, the program will fall back to a "classic" terminal interface.

to run, open or compile `SortingVisualizer.opal` using the opal compiler.

here you can find a video about the program: https://youtu.be/9ZuYW9bnCGw
