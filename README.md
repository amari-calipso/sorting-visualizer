# sorting-visualizer
 A sorting visualizer written in opal

before running or compiling, please set the program's directory in the first line of `SortingVisualizer.opal` (replace `PROJECT_DIRECTORY` with your directory)
note: quadruple your slashes if you're on Windows.

the visualizer uses a text user interface made with picotui, so it won't work on Windows. instead, the program will fall back to a "classic" terminal interface.

to run, open or compile `SortingVisualizer.opal` using the opal compiler.
